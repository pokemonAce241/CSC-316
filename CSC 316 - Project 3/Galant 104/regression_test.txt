Testing protocol for Galant.

- create a new graph with two nodes and one edge; give both nodes and the edge a color, weight, and label

- open test (in Example_Graphs) and move some nodes around

- run dfs_d on eight_node_graph (in Example_Graphs)

- run dijkstra on weighted_example (in Example_Graphs), with graph both undirected and directed

- run kruskal on weighted_example

- run insertion_sort on sorting_test (in Example_Graphs)

- load 0_simple (in Crossing_Graphs) and make sure it draws properly (responds to changes in window size)

- run both barycenter and mce on 1_test (in Crossing Graphs)

- ditto for r_100_110_10_0_0p7 (in Crossing_Graphs)

- run sifting on 1_test
