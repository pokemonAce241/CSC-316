for

Originally
intended

the

During
the
last
decade
of
the
th
century
Germany
has
transformed
its
attitude
towards
immigrants
considerably
Until
the
mid
nineties
the
opinion
was
widespread
that
Germany
is
not
a
country
of
immigration
even
though
about
of
the
population
were
of
non
German
origin
After
the
end
of
the
influx
of
so
called
Gastarbeiter
blue
collar
guest
workers
refugees
were
a
tolerated
exception
to
this
point
of
view
Many
guest
workers
were
of
Turkish
origins
and
brought
an
interesting
influence
into
the
country
Today
the
government
and
much
of
German
society
are
acknowledging
the
opinion
that
controlled
immigration
should
be
allowed
based
on
the
qualification
of
immigrants
With
an
expenditure
of
billion
on
international
travel
in
Germans
spent
more
money
on
travel
than
any
other
country
The
most
visited
foreign
destinations
were
Spain
Italy
