Etymology
About
the
origin
of
the
name
Roma
several
hypotheses
have
been
advanced
The
most
important
are
the
following
from
Rommylos
Romulus
son
of
Ascanius
and
founder
of
the
city
from
Rumon
or
Rumen
archaic
name
of
Tiber
It
has
the
same
root
of
the
Greek
verb
ῥέω
rhèo
and
of
the
Latin
verb
ruo
which
both
mean
flow
from
the
Etruscan
word
ruma
whose
root
is
rum
teat
with
possible
reference
either
to
the
totem
wolf
that
adopted
and
suckled
the
cognately
named
twins
Romulus
and
Remus
or
to
the
shape
of
Palatine
and
Aventine
hills
from
the
Greek
word
ῤώμη
rhòme
which
means
strength

Rome
s
early
history
is
shrouded
in
legend
According
to
Roman
tradition
the
city
was
founded
by
Romulus
on
April
BC
The
legendary
origin
of
the
city
tells
that
Romulus
and
Remus
decided
to
build
a
city
After
an
argument
Romulus
killed
his
brother
Remus
Archaeological
evidence
supports
the
view
that
Rome
grew
from
pastoral
settlements
on
the
Palatine
Hill
built
in
the
area
of
the
future
Roman
Forum
While
some
archaeologists
argue
that
Rome
was
indeed
founded
in
the
middle
of
the
th
century
BC
the
date
is
subject
to
controversy
The
original
settlement
developed
into
the
capital
of
the
Roman
Kingdom
ruled
by
a
succession
of
seven
kings
according
to
tradition
and
then
the
Roman
Republic
from
BC
governed
by
the
Senate
and
finally
the
Roman
Empire
from
BC
ruled
by
an
Emperor
This
success
depended
on
military
conquest
commercial
predominance
as
well
as
selective
assimilation
of
neighbouring
civilisations
most
notably
the
Etruscans
and
Greeks
From
its
foundation
Rome
although
losing
occasional
battles
had
been
undefeated
in
war
until
BC
when
it
was
briefly
occupied
by
the
Gauls
According
to
the
legend
the
Gauls
offered
to
deliver
Rome
back
to
its
people
for
a
thousand
pounds
of
gold
but
the
Romans
refused
preferring
to
take
back
their
city
by
force
of
arms
rather
than
ever
admitting
defeat
after
which
the
Romans
recovered
the
city
in
the
same
year
The
Roman
Republic
was
wealthy
powerful
and
stable
before
it
became
an
empire
According
to
tradition
Rome
became
a
republic
in
BC
However
it
took
a
few
centuries
for
Rome
to
become
the
great
city
of
popular
imagination
and
it
only
became
a
great
empire
after
the
rule
of
Augustus
Octavian
By
the
rd
century
BC
Rome
had
become
the
pre
eminent
city
of
the
Italian
peninsula
having
conquered
and
defeated
the
Sabines
the
Etruscans
the
Samnites
and
most
of
the
Greek
colonies
in
Sicily
Campania
and
Southern
Italy
in
general
During
the
Punic
Wars
between
Rome
and
the
great
Mediterranean
empire
of
Carthage
Rome
s
stature
increased
further
as
it
became
the
capital
of
an
overseas
empire
for
the
first
time
Beginning
in
the
nd
century
BC
Rome
went
through
a
significant
population
expansion
as
Italian
farmers
driven
from
their
ancestral
farmlands
by
the
advent
of
massive
slave
operated
farms
called
latifundia
flocked
to
the
city
in
great
numbers
The
victory
over
Carthage
in
the
First
Punic
War
brought
the
first
two
provinces
outside
the
Italian
peninsula
Sicily
and
Sardinia
Parts
of
Spain
Hispania
followed
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
nd
century
the
Romans
got
involved
in
the
affairs
of
the
Greek
world
By
then
all
Hellenistic
kingdoms
and
the
Greek
city
states
were
in
decline
exhausted
from
endless
civil
wars
and
relying
on
mercenary
troops
This
saw
the
fall
of
Greece
after
the
Battle
of
Corinth
BC
and
the
establishment
of
Roman
control
over
Greece
The
Roman
Empire
at
its
greatest
extent
The
Roman
Empire
had
begun
in
a
more
formalised
way
when
Emperor
Augustus
BC
AD
known
as
Octavian
before
his
throne
accession
founded
the
Principate
in
BC
This
was
a
monarchy
system
which
was
headed
by
an
emperor
holding
power
for
life
rather
than
making
himself
dictator
like
Julius
Caesar
had
done
which
had
resulted
in
his
assassination
on
March
BC
At
home
Emperor
Augustus
started
off
a
great
programme
of
social
political
and
economic
reform
and
grand
scale
reconstruction
of
the
city
of
Rome
The
city
became
dotted
with
impressive
and
magnificent
new
buildings
palaces
fora
and
basilicae
Augustus
became
a
great
and
enlightened
patron
of
the
arts
and
his
court
was
attended
by
poets
as
Virgil
Horace
and
Propertius
His
rule
also
established
the
Pax
Romana
a
long
period
of
relative
peace
which
lasted
approximately
years
Following
his
rule
were
emperors
such
as
Caligula
Nero
Trajan
and
Hadrian

myth

he
was

emperor

Rome
burned

night
of
to

AD
Roman
dominance
expanded
over
most
of
Western
Europe
and
the
shores
of
the
Mediterranean
Sea
though
its
influence
through
client
states
and
the
sheer
power
of
its
presence
was
wider
than
its
formal
borders
Its
population
surpassed
one
million
inhabitants
For
almost
a
thousand
years
Rome
was

city
in

After

The
latter
half
of
the
th

saw
the
seat
of
the
Italian
Renaissance
move
to
Rome
from
Florence
The
Papacy
wanted
to
equal

surpass
the
grandeur
of
other
Italian
cities
and
to
this
end
created
ever
more
extravagant

the

The

San

The
period
was
also
infamous
for
papal
corruption
with
many
Popes
fathering
children
and
engaging
in
nepotism
and
simony
The
corruption
of
the
Popes

led
in

the

Popes
such
as
Alexander
VI
were
well
known
for
their
decadence
wild

extravagance
and

under
these
extravagant

popes
Rome
was
transformed
into

Topography
Rome
seen
from
satellite
Throughout
the
history
of
Rome
the
urban
limits
of
the
city
were
considered
to
be
the
area
within
the
city
walls
Originally
these
consisted
of
the
Servian
Wall
which
was
built
twelve
years
after
the
Gaulish
sack
of
the
city
in
BC
This
contained
most
of
the
Esquiline
and
Caelian
hills
as
well
as
the
whole
of
the
other
five
Rome
outgrew
the
Servian
Wall
but
no
more
walls
were
constructed
until
almost
years
later
when
in
AD
Emperor
Aurelian
began
building
the
Aurelian
Walls
These
were
almost
kilometres
mi
long
and
were
still
the
walls
the
troops
of
the
Kingdom
of
Italy
had
to
breach
to
enter
the
city

Modern
Romans
frequently
consider
the
city
s
urban
area
to
be
delimited
by
its
ring
road
the
Grande
Raccordo
Anulare
which
circles
the
city
centre
at
a
distance
of
about
km
The
Commune
of
Rome
however
covers
considerably
more
territory
and
extends
to
the
sea
at
Ostia
the
largest
town
in
Italy
that
is
not
a
commune
in
its
own
right
The
Commune
covers
an
area
roughly
three
times
the
total
area
within
the
Raccordo
and
is
comparable
in
area
to
the
entire
provinces
of
Milan
and
Naples
and
to
an
area
six
times
the
size
of
the
territory
of
these
cities
It
also
includes
considerable
areas
of
abandoned
marsh
land
which
is
suitable
neither
for
agriculture
nor
for
urban
development
As
a
consequence
the
density
of
the
Commune
is
not
that
high

urbanised
areas

Acqua
Paola
Rome
is
a
city
famous
for
its
numerous
fountains
built
in
all
different
styles
from
Classical
and
Medieval
to
Baroque
and
Neoclassical
The
city
has
had
fountains
for
more
than
two
thousand
years
and
they
have
provided
drinking
water
and
decorated
the
piazzas
of
Rome
During
the
Roman
Empire
in
A
D
according
to
Sextus
Julius
Frontinus
the
Roman
consul
who
was
named
curator
aquarum
or
guardian
of
the
water
of
the
city
Rome
had
nine
aqueducts
which
fed
monumental
fountains
and
public
basins
not
counting
the
water
supplied
to
the
Imperial
household
baths
and
owners
of
private
villas
Each
of
the
major
fountains
was
connected
to
two
different
aqueducts
in
case
one
was
shut
down
for
service
During
the
th
and
th
century
the
Roman
popes
reconstructed
other
ruined
Roman
acqueducts
and
built
new
display
fountains
to
mark
their
termini
launching
the
golden
age
of
the
Roman
fountain
The
fountains
of
Rome
like
the
paintings
of
Rubens
were
expressions
of
the
new
style
of
Baroque
art
They
were
crowded
with
allegorical
figures
and
filled
with
emotion
and
movement
In
these
fountains
sculpture
became
the
principal
element
and
the
water
was
used
simply
to
animate
and
decorate
the
sculptures
They
like
baroque
gardens
were
a
visual
representation
of
confidence
and
power

Though
most
famous
for
Christian
burials
they
include
pagan
and
Jewish
burials
either
in
separate
catacombs
or
mixed
together
The
first
large
scale
catacombs
were
excavated
from
the
nd
century
onwards
Originally
they
were
carved
through
tuff
a
soft
volcanic
rock
outside
the
boundaries
of
the
city
because
Roman
law
forbade
burial
places
within
city
limits
Currently
maintenance
of
the
catacombs
is
in
the
hands
of

were
active

Rome
s

has
evolved
through
centuries
and
periods
of
social
cultural
and
political
changes
Rome
became
a
major
gastronomical
centre
during
Ancient
Rome
Ancient
Roman
cuisine
was
highly
influenced
by
Ancient
Greek
culture
and
after
the
empire
s
enormous
expansion
exposed
Romans
to
many
new
provincial
culinary
habits
and
cooking
techniques
In
the
beginning
the
differences
between
social
classes
were
not
very
great
but
disparities
developed
with
the
empire
s
growth
Later
during
the
Renaissance
Rome
became
well
known
as
a
centre
of
high
cuisine
since
some
of
the
best
chefs
of
the
time
worked
for
the
popes
An
example
of
this
could
be
Bartolomeo
Scappi
who
was
a
chef
working
for
Pius
IV
in
the
Vatican
kitchen
and
he
acquired
fame
in
when
his
cookbook
Opera
dell

was
published
In
the
book
he
lists
approximately
recipes
of
the
Renaissance
cuisine
and
describes
cooking
techniques
and

Roman
dialect
and
Latin
The
original
language
of
Rome
was
Latin
which
evolved
during
the
Middle
Ages
into
Italian
The
latter
emerged
as
the
confluence
of
various
regional
dialects
among
which
the
Tuscan
dialect
predominated
but
the
population
of
Rome
also
developed
its
own
dialect
the
Romanesco
The
ancient
Romanesco
used
during
the
Middle
Ages
was
a
southern
Italian
dialect
very
close
to
the
Neapolitan
The
influence
of
the
Florentine
culture
during
the
renaissance
and
above
all
the
immigration
to
Rome
of
many
Florentines
amongst
them
the
two
Medici
Popes
Leo
X
and
Clement
VII
and
their
suite
caused
a
major
shift
in
the
dialect
which
began
to
resemble
more
the
Tuscan
varieties
This
remained
largely
confined
to
Rome
until
the
th
century
but
then
expanded
to
other
zones
of
Lazio
Civitavecchia
Latina
from
the
beginning
of
the
th
century
thanks
to
the
rising
population
of
Rome
and
to
better
transportation
systems
As
a
consequence
Romanesco
abandoned
its
traditional
forms
to
mutate
into
the
dialect
spoken
within
the
city
which
is
more
like
standard
Italian
although
it
remains
distinct
from
the
other
Romanesco
influenced
local
dialects
of
Lazio
Dialectal
literature
in
the
traditional
form
Romanesco
includes
the
works
of
such
authors
as
Giuseppe
Gioachino
Belli
Trilussa
and
Cesare
Pascarella
Contemporary
Romanesco
is
mainly
represented
by
popular
actors
such
as
Aldo
Fabrizi
Alberto
Sordi
Nino
Manfredi
Anna
Magnani
Gigi
Proietti
Enrico
Montesano
and
Carlo
Verdone
Rome
s
historic
contribution
to
language
in
a
worldwide
sense
is
much
more
extensive
however
Through
the
process
of
Romanisation
the
peoples
of
Gallia
the
Iberian
Peninsula
Italy
and
Dacia
developed
languages
which
derive
directly
from
Latin
and
were
adopted
in
large
areas
of
the
world
both
through
colonization
and
cultural
influence
Moreover
also
modern
English
because
of
the
Norman
Conquest
borrowed
a
large
percentage
of
its
vocabulary
from
the
Latin
Language
The
Roman
or
Latin
alphabet
is
the
most
widely
used
writing
system
in
the
world
used
by
the
greatest
number
of
languages

south
west
of

about
km
north
of
the
city
centre
which
handles

The
city
suffers
from
traffic
problems
largely
due

making
it

the
radial
roads
to
another
without
going
into
the

by
the
limited
